# ENGO-651--Final-Project
Group Project by Sai Dheeraj and Saiveer

The aim of this research is to examine and identify the shortest distance from the schools to hospitals. The web page allows user to register and login into the required portal that shows the base map of city of Calgary. Here the user can select the required option that be a school he/she want to visit and soon the resulted hospital from the school with the shortest distance will be highlighted. The trajectorial distance is also involved in this project and the plan can be made using the distance and the route can be changed accordingly.
With this project, we want to give the user a user-friendly web page which can help the user to know the nearest destination from the different schools. For the study we have taken schools, public library, transit stops, community boundaries into the count where it can help the students, graduates and general public.

5	TRAJECTORIAL DISTANCE
After all the school information has been collected and if you want to plan a route involving multiple locations and want to know the distance covering all the locations that can also be done using the distance calculation button on the main page. The distance of the entire trajectory pops up on the left side of the page.
